# Naming & Domain Decision

**Project:** Relay
**Domain:** relayfunds.org

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains the rationale behind the selected **application name** and **domain name** for the Relay pilot. The goal is to make the choice legible, intentional, and aligned with the project’s core values: safety, trust, coordination, and restraint.

## Application Name: **Relay**

### Chosen Name

**Relay**

### Rationale

The name *Relay* was selected because it accurately describes the function of the project **without implying authority, ownership, or surveillance**.

Key reasons for this choice:

* **Functional, not institutional**
  “Relay” describes the act of passing resources or information between trusted parties. It does not suggest governance, adjudication, or central control.

* **Neutral and human**
  The word is familiar, non-technical, and easy to use in conversation. It does not feel like a product, platform, or program.

* **Aligned with scope**
  Relay exists *between* fund hubs and local groups. It does not decide who receives aid, and it does not manage cases. The name reflects this intermediary role.

* **Low risk in mutual aid contexts**
  The name avoids language commonly associated with surveillance, compliance, or bureaucracy (e.g., “registry,” “verification,” “system,” “network”).

* **Durable but modest**
  “Relay” works for a pilot without over-signaling permanence or scale.

### Intentional Exclusions

The name deliberately avoids:

* Terms implying authority or oversight
* Language associated with data collection or tracking
* Branding that suggests growth, platforms, or startups

## Domain Name: **relayfunds.org**

### Chosen Domain

**relayfunds.org**

### Rationale

The domain name complements the application name by providing **clarity of purpose** while preserving the neutrality of the core name.

Key reasons for this choice:

* **Clarifies function without redefining the product**
  The word “funds” communicates that Relay operates in the context of moving money between trusted groups, without implying donor-facing features or financial control.

* **Appropriate top-level domain (`.org`)**
  `.org` aligns with nonprofit, mutual aid, and public-interest work. It avoids commercial or startup connotations.

* **Separation of name and function**
  Using a descriptive domain allows the application name (“Relay”) to remain simple and human, while the domain provides context when needed.

* **Signals restraint and intent**
  The domain does not imply permanence, ownership, or centralization of sensitive data.

## How the Name and Domain Are Used Together

* **Application name:** Relay
* **Primary domain:** relayfunds.org

Recommended usage:

* First reference:

  > *Relay (relayfunds.org) is a coordination pilot…*

* Subsequent references:

  > *Relay…*

The application UI, documentation, and communications should consistently refer to the product as **Relay**, using the domain only for access and formal identification.

## Naming Principles This Decision Reflects

This naming decision intentionally prioritizes:

* Trust over branding
* Function over abstraction
* Safety over memorability
* Clarity over cleverness

The name and domain are designed to **reduce friction and suspicion**, not to attract attention.

---

## Conclusion

The combination of **Relay** and **relayfunds.org** provides:

* A clear description of purpose
* A low-risk, non-authoritative identity
* Alignment with mutual aid values and privacy concerns
* Flexibility for a small, invite-only pilot

This choice supports the project’s core goal: enabling safer coordination between fund hubs and local mutual aid groups without expanding scope or risk.
