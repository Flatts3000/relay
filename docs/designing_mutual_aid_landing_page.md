# Designing a Mutual Aid Platform Landing Page

The landing page must clearly address **three audiences** -- mutual aid groups, fund hubs, and individuals in crisis -- while building trust and ensuring anonymity.

---

## Audience-Focused Structure

- **Segment by user goal.** Organize content by what each group needs, not by internal departments. Use audience-specific navigation or sections labeled "For Groups," "For Funders/Hubs," and "For Help Seekers." This lets each visitor immediately find the relevant pathway. One nonprofit example highlights distinct entry buttons ("Get Meals," "Donate," "Volunteer") so users can "self-select the journey they need." [1][2]
- **Minimize menu options.** Limit the number of calls-to-action (CTAs) on the homepage. Experts advise featuring only 1--3 CTAs in prominent spots. For example, God's Love We Deliver uses just three clear buttons ("Get Meals," "Donate," "Volunteer") so visitors aren't overwhelmed. [2][3]
- **Consolidate content.** Don't try to serve every need on the homepage. Treat it as a "launchpad" that orients users and points them deeper. Use concise sections or cards for each audience (e.g. a "Groups" card, a "Hubs" card, a "Need Help?" card). Link each to more detailed subpages or flows. This mirrors the suggestion to "break up your design" into a few focused pages (Home, Get Help, Volunteer) with clear, action-oriented descriptions. [4][5]

---

## Headlines and Messaging

- **Mission-driven headline.** Lead with a clear mission statement. Social-impact sites "should have an identifiable mission that is prominently featured." For example, Open Collective's homepage tagline is "Raise and spend money with full transparency," immediately stating purpose and values. An analogous headline for Relay might say: _"Connect Neighbors, Stream Funds, Protect Privacy."_ [6][7]
- **Empathetic tone.** Use warm, inclusive language. For individuals in crisis, be _clear, welcoming, and stigma-free._ Avoid jargon or anything that feels clinical or salesy. For groups and hubs, emphasize collaboration and impact ("Join hundreds of local groups", "Help communities together", etc.). The tone should feel human and supportive for all. [8]
- **Plain explanation.** In brief copy blocks, explain _what_ the platform is and _how_ it works, in plain terms. Nonprofit advice urges writing so any visitor instantly "understand the purpose of the page." For example, a subtitle could be: _"Relay connects local mutual aid groups with community funds and helps neighbors in need -- anonymously and securely."_ [9]
- **Trust-building copy.** To build trust, mention privacy and safety upfront. For instance, a tagline or note like _"No signup, no tracking, 100% anonymous"_ reassures users. One tech privacy guideline emphasizes transparency: "Tell users what's happening to their data in plain language." A brief bullet or link to a plain-language privacy statement can help. [10]

---

## Visual Design

- **Inclusive imagery.** Use friendly, community-oriented images or icons (e.g. illustrations of diverse people helping each other). Ensure high contrast and legible text if overlaid. All visuals must have descriptive alt text (accessibility best practice). [11]
- **Consistent branding.** Choose a calm, trustworthy color palette (blues, greens) and simple graphics. Avoid clutter. Nonprofit landing pages often _minimize distractions_ to keep focus. For example, using a single prominent hero image or illustration (with alt text) under a bold headline. [12]
- **Visual guides.** Use icons or color blocks to differentiate audience sections. Antarctic's guide suggests "visual guides: use icons, color-coded sections, or checklists" to help users navigate. For instance, an icon of a group, an icon of a fund/hub, and an icon of a helping hand next to each CTA can orient users quickly. [1]
- **Trust signals.** Include visual cues of legitimacy. This could be logos of partner organizations or fund hubs, data security badges (e.g. an SSL lock icon), or quotes from community leaders. Trust-signal best practices include displaying "security badges, SSL/HTTPS indicators, [and] data privacy" cues. Also prominently feature an "About" or "Our Mission" graphic (see trust signal: "Clear company info: team, 'About us,' contact info") so users see a human team behind the site. [13]

---

## Calls to Action (CTAs)

- **Action words per audience.** Use concise, action-driven CTAs tailored to each user. E.g. for groups: _"Join the Network"_ or _"Add Your Group"_; for hubs: _"Register as a Fund Hub"_; for individuals: _"Find Help Near You."_ Avoid vague CTAs like "Submit" or "Learn More" -- make them specific. The Antarctic guide emphasizes matching CTA language to user intent (e.g. "Get Help," "Donate," "Volunteer"). [1]
- **Placement and prominence.** Put the main CTAs in the hero section (e.g. buttons under the headline) and repeat them in each relevant section. For instance, each audience box could end with a button. Nonprofit sites often put a primary CTA button in the top right or center to guide action. Ensure buttons have high contrast. [3][14]
- **One primary CTA per user type.** Don't overwhelm with multiple actions at once. As advised, a homepage should "only feature 1--3 calls to action." You could have exactly three CTAs (one per audience). For example, a three-column layout with headings "I'm a Group Leader", "I'm a Fund Organization", "I Need Help" each followed by a single button. This echoes the successful structure on the God's Love We Deliver site. [2][3]

---

## Tone and Copy Style

- **Empathy and respect.** Especially for individuals in crisis, use gentle, reassuring language. Phrases like "you're not alone" or "we understand tough times" can be supportive. Avoid any wording that might sound blaming or judgmental. Crisis support best practices say content should be "clear, welcoming, and stigma-free." [8]
- **Plain language.** Write simply and directly. Use short sentences and bulleted lists for key points. Nonprofits should avoid generic buzzwords; instead "speak directly to someone." For example, say "Relay is free and anonymous" rather than technical jargon. [15]
- **Inclusive phrasing.** Use "we" and "our" to build community (e.g. "We help local neighborhoods...") and "you" when addressing the user (e.g. "Find help near you today"). This helps each user feel personally addressed, as recommended ("Homepage? Inspire. Get Help page? Make it personal and actionable"). [16]

---

## Accessibility and Mobile

- **WCAG compliance.** Design for all users: high color contrast, resizable fonts, and clear focus indicators. Use semantic HTML (headings, landmarks) so screen readers can navigate. At minimum meet WCAG AA. As one report notes, mutual aid tools should be "WCAG-compliant and usable." [17]
- **Keyboard and screen-reader friendly.** Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) are reachable by tabbing. Provide descriptive alt text for every image. One UX tip: "Accessible design is more inclusive. Check that your colors are high-contrast, legible fonts. Add keyboard navigation and alt text." [11]
- **Mobile-first layout.** Most users will be on phones, so use a vertical, scrollable design. Make buttons large/tappable and avoid hover-only features. Keep content bite-sized per screen. For example, each audience section might stack vertically on mobile, each with its icon, short text, and CTA button. [11]

---

## Privacy-Forward Design

- **Minimal data collection.** Collect only what's strictly necessary. For a crisis user, ideally no data at all. The privacy-first principle is "Minimize data collection: only collect what's absolutely necessary." For example, allow help-seekers to search or get directed to a group _without_ signing in or giving an email. [18]
- **Explicit anonymity.** Emphasize that no identifying information is required. For instance: "No login needed -- find help anonymously." One privacy guideline suggests offering guest or one-time access codes instead of account sign-ups. Relay could let individuals browse or chat without an account or email. [18]
- **No trackers or cookies.** To foster trust, the site should not load any third-party analytics or ads. State this clearly: e.g. "We use no cookies or tracking -- your browsing is private." This reflects a "no cookies policy" example where a site declared "no tracking cookies are placed on your device...no third-party tracking scripts are used." Including a brief note like this (or a privacy banner with a "no data collected" statement) reassures wary users. [19]
- **Transparent data policies.** Link to a clear, concise privacy statement. Use plain language (one privacy principle advises making even the privacy policy "kid-friendly" with visuals). A bullet list of key points (e.g. "What info we _don't_ collect" and "How your info is protected") can help. [10]

---

## Trust and Credibility

- **Show the team and story.** Have an "About Us" or "Who We Are" link where visitors can learn about the organizers or partners. The Mutual Aid Arlington guide explicitly says a prominent "Who We Are" section "really helps newcomers to trust your group." Include names/photos of organizers or logos of supporting organizations to personalize the site. [20]
- **Partner logos or endorsements.** If Relay is affiliated with known nonprofits, universities, or local governments, display their logos or a "Supported by:" section. Trust signals research notes that third-party logos and social proof reduce user uncertainty. Even a small note like "Endorsed by [Trusted Org]" can reassure funders and visitors. [13]
- **SSL and security cues.** Ensure the site is HTTPS (showing the padlock) and consider a security badge near forms. Trust signals include explicit SSL/HTTPS indicators. A subtle lock icon by a signup form (if any) can increase confidence. [13]
- **Outcome emphasis.** For fund hubs and groups, highlight impact stats if available (e.g. "100 groups onboarded" or "$X disbursed"). While respecting privacy, generalized metrics or testimonials (anonymous quotes from satisfied groups, for instance) act as social proof. This is a common high-conversion tactic on donation sites. [21]

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mutual Aid Groups** (Organizers, volunteers)  | Emphasize community and collaboration. Headline: "Get Resources. Help Your Neighbors." Mission statement about connecting groups to funds.              | "Join the Network" / "Register Your Group" CTA. Highlight benefits (e.g. fast funding, verified donors). Link to details: How to list group, success stories.                            | Supportive, resource-focused tone. Reassure minimal data needed (e.g. "We only ask for a name, no sensitive personal info"). Privacy note: data shared only with member hubs (no public listing of individuals). |
| **Fund Hubs** (Central funders, nonprofits)     | Emphasize credibility and impact. Headline: "Find and Support Verified Local Groups." Message about due diligence and transparency.                     | "Become a Fund Partner" / "List Your Hub" CTA. Explain verification process for groups. Showcase any existing partners/logos for trust.                                                  | Professional, trustworthy tone. Stress secure platform and open-source values (e.g. "All funds tracked transparently"). Privacy: emphasize compliance (no selling data).                                         |
| **Individuals in Crisis** (People seeking help) | Emphasize help is available and anonymity. Headline: "Need Help? We've Got You -- No Signup Needed." Calm message: "Find local support confidentially." | "Get Help Now" / "Find a Local Group" CTA. Possibly a search box (by zip/community) or map to locate groups. Clear steps: "Choose need type (food, housing, etc.), connect anonymously." | Empathetic, friendly tone (avoid alarmist language). Highlight privacy: "No email. No tracking. Ever." as a trust line. Accessible wording (e.g. simple, short sentences) for low-stress reading.                |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Clarity & Focus:** Use a mission-first headline and clear subheads. Limit CTAs so each visitor sees one main action.
2. **Segmented Content:** Present three distinct pathways ("Groups", "Hubs", "Need Help") with targeted copy and buttons. [1][2]
3. **Trust-Building:** Feature privacy assurances (no-tracking badges, privacy notice) and credibility (About page, partner logos, SSL). [13][19][20]
4. **Privacy by Design:** Adopt the "privacy-first" principles -- collect minimal data, require no login for help seekers, and avoid any analytics scripts. [18][19]
5. **Accessibility:** Ensure WCAG compliance (high contrast, alt text, keyboard nav) so all users -- including disabled and non-English speakers -- can use the site. [11][17]
6. **Tone & Empathy:** Use simple, compassionate language. Speak directly to each audience's needs (e.g., "You're not alone," or "Make your community stronger"). Avoid platitudes; be concrete and human.

By combining mission-driven headlines, segmented user journeys, strong privacy guarantees, and inclusive design, the landing page will quickly orient all users to Relay's purpose and guide them to the right next step. [3][6][18][19]
