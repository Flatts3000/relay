# Pilot Proposal

## Mutual Aid Group ↔ Fund Hub Coordination Pilot

## Purpose

The goal of this pilot is to test a safer, faster way for local mutual aid groups to connect with centralized fund hubs—without collecting or storing individual recipient data, and without changing how aid is distributed on the ground.

This pilot is explicitly not about creating applications for assistance, tracking individuals, or standardizing how groups do their work.

## What Problem This Pilot Addresses

Today, most coordination between local mutual aid groups and centralized funds happens through:

- Word of mouth
- Ad hoc emails, DMs, or Google Forms
- Personal networks that unintentionally leave gaps

This works, but unevenly. New or smaller groups struggle to get connected, hubs struggle to discover groups safely, and everyone spends more time coordinating than moving resources.

This pilot tests whether a minimal coordination layer can reduce friction while respecting safety, privacy, and autonomy.

## Scope of the Pilot

### Duration

30–45 days

### Participants

- 1 central fund hub (e.g., a statewide mutual aid fund)
- 3–5 local mutual aid groups
- 1 pilot facilitator / builder (me)

Participation is opt-in and can be ended at any time by any party.

## What the Pilot Includes

### 1. Group Registry (Private, Invite-Only)

Participating groups are listed in a private registry visible only to the hub.

**Collected information (minimal):**

- Group name (can be pseudonymous)
- Service area (city/region)
- Aid categories supported (e.g., rent, food, utilities)
- Preferred contact method (role-based email or equivalent)
- Verification status (see below)

**Explicitly excluded:**

- Individual names of aid recipients
- Addresses
- Immigration status
- Case details

### 2. Lightweight Verification

Verification exists solely to establish "trusted enough" status for routing funds.

**Accepted methods:**

- Hub-admin approval
- Peer attestation (e.g., two existing groups vouch)
- Known sponsor reference (church, nonprofit, etc.)

No IDs, rosters, or sensitive documents are required.

### 3. Funding Request Workflow (Group-Level Only)

Groups submit funding requests on behalf of their work, not individuals.

**Each request includes:**

- Amount requested
- Category (rent / food / utilities / etc.)
- Urgency (normal / urgent)
- Region served
- Optional short justification (with explicit guidance not to include personal details)

The hub can approve, decline, or ask clarifying questions at the group level.

### 4. Payout Status Tracking

The system tracks only:

- Request submitted
- Approved
- Funds sent
- Acknowledged

No receipts, narratives, or recipient data are required.

### 5. Aggregate Transparency

The pilot produces aggregate-only summaries, such as:

- Total funds routed by category
- Number of groups supported
- Time-to-funding averages

No per-person or per-household reporting.

## What Is Explicitly Out of Scope

To avoid risk and scope creep, the following are not part of this pilot:

- Individual aid applications
- Case management
- Recipient data storage
- Document uploads
- Donor-facing dashboards
- Messaging or chat
- Automation of eligibility decisions

If any of these become necessary, the pilot pauses and is reevaluated.

## Data & Safety Guardrails

- No collection of recipient PII
- Strong UX guidance discouraging sensitive data entry
- Short data retention for request details
- Aggregate reporting only
- No public directory
- No data sharing outside pilot participants
- **Veto power:** Any participating group or hub may pause or end the pilot if it feels unsafe or misaligned.

## Success Criteria (How We'll Know This Helped)

This pilot is successful if:

- A group can get connected without relying on personal introductions
- The hub can review and route funds with less back-and-forth
- Funds move faster than before
- Participants say this feels safer than existing ad hoc tools
- No one asks for recipient data because the system doesn't need it

If these aren't met, the pilot is considered unsuccessful and stopped.

## What Comes After (Only If the Pilot Works)

If—and only if—the pilot proves useful and safe:

- Participants decide whether to continue, expand, or stop
- Any next steps are co-designed with organizers
- No expansion happens by default

## Why This Approach

This pilot prioritizes:

- Trust over scale
- Coordination over control
- Safety over convenience

The intent is to support the work already happening—not reshape it.

## Next Steps

1. Confirm interest from 1 hub and 3–5 groups
2. Agree on pilot duration and start date
3. Launch with a closed, invite-only setup
